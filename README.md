# Voice Journal - Talk to Your AI Friend

> An experiment in feeling less alone at the end of long days.

## What This Is

A privacy-first voice journaling app that runs entirely on your Mac. 
You talk, it listens, it asks thoughtful questions.

## Status: 🚧 Weekend Project 🚧

This is rough. There are hardcoded paths. The UI is nonexistent. 
But it works for me, and maybe it'll work for you.

## Quick Start

<Coming soon>
  
## Tech Stack

- Whisper.cpp (local transcription)
- Llama.cpp (local LLM)
- Piper TTS (local text-to-speech)
- FastAPI

## Roadmap

- [ ] Memory across sessions
- [ ] Better UI
- [ ] Package as desktop app
- [ ] Multi-platform support

## Why Local-First?

Your journal entries never leave your machine. No cloud, no tracking, no data breaches.

## Contributing
